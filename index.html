# Signal Start Node

## Overview
To kick off your workflow, you can use a Signal Start node. When you create a new workflow, a
Signal Start node appears in the Authenticated swim lane by default.

Unlike other workflow nodes, the Signal Start node doesn't have an input port. Since it's always
the first node in your workflow, your Signal Start node won't have any preceding nodes.

The Signal Start node does include a single output port, letting you connect to 1 other node.
Don't worry if you need more than one Signal Start point in your workflow. You can have several
Signal Start nodes in a single workflow. However, your workflow must have 1 primary Signal
Start node. You’ll position your primary Signal Start at the very beginning of your workflow.
You’ll find the Signal Start node in the list of nodes on the left of the Workflow Editor.
